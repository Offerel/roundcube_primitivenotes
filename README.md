# PrimitiveNotes Plugin (Roundcube)
This is a notes plugin for Roundcube. Mainly notes in Markdown, but also images (jpg, png) and PDF files are supported. The files are stored in a name-compatible format to TagSpaces, so that you can transfer these notes directly. 

# History
Originally, the idea for a standalone note app came from that I wanted to separate my notes from Evernote. Afterwards I ended up at TagSpaces. As TagSpace was too slow and extensive for me personally, I decided to develop my own app. This resulted first in a standalone project and was converted later to this plugin for Roundcube.
