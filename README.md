# PrimitiveNotes Plugin (Roundcube)
This is a notes plugin for Roundcube. Mainly notes in Markdown, but also images (jpg, png) and PDF files are supported. The files are stored in a name-compatible format to TagSpaces, so that you can transfer these notes directly. 

# History
Originally, the idea for a standalone note app came from that I wanted to separate my notes from Evernote. Afterwards I ended up at TagSpaces. As TagSpace was too slow and extensive for me personally, I decided to develop my own app. This resulted first in a standalone project and was converted later to this plugin for Roundcube.

# Installation
Please see the chapter in the [Wiki](../../../../../Offerel/roundcube_primitivenotes/wiki/#installation).

# Issues
Please create issues in the [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/Offerel/roundcube_primitivenotes/issues) issue tracker. I have disabled the issue tracker in GitHub.com because the repo there is only used as a workaround and for compatibility reasons.
